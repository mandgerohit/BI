# You're about to write two nested for-loops that loop over an entire matrix and return the sum of all its elements! Note it is more conventional to access each row and column element of the matrix by their position. For example M[2,3] will access the element in the second row and third column of the matrix.

# IMPORTANT NOTE: Nested loops are very costly! If you have two nested loops that accesses n elements each, then the total number of iterations will n^2 (n-squared). For large values of n, this computation may take hours to finish!

# Save the script before typing submit() in the console after you edit it.

nested_for<- function(matrix=data) {

  total_sum <- 0
 

  # Code the nested for-loops that sums all matrix elements
  
  # Return the resulting sum
    
}
