- If you look at the top-right side of the RStudio GUI you will see two tabs: "Environment" & "History"
- Click the "History" tab
- To Save your history for that lesson, click the "Save" icon and save it to a folder, you create, named R-Tutorial-Username -> you will upload this zipped folder with 21 Rhistory files (for each swirl() lesson) to the Course Assignment Submission Page for grading
- Clear the history after each lesson by clicking the "Paint Brush" icon under the "History Tab".
- PLEASE MAKE SURE THE HISTORY FILE SAVES BEFORE YOU MOVE ON TO THE NEXT MODULE
   - If for some reason you find the Rhistory files not being saved:   
   - Completely exit out of swirl(), then save.
   - Restart RStudio then save.
   - Alternate the locations where you are saving the file to.
